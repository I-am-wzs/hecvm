Overview of HEC on Win32
------------------------

There are 4 batch files which you can use to build and maintain HEC

1) bldall.bat 	- makes all the win32 binaries
2) mvbin.bat  	- moves all the win32 binaries to the win32\bin directory
3) wipe.bat   	- deletes all the win32 binaries
4) bldapps.bat  - builds the test application .RUN files
 
Pop the CD in to your computer and copy the win32 directory tree
to your hard drive

Building HEC
------------
The first thing you will need to do is open a DOS command prompt window

Next, run the vcvars32.bat file, which sets up the environment for Visual C++.
If you're using a Borland compiler, you will need to find a way to make sure
that it's executables can be found by the Windows runtime. 

CD ( i.e. use the cd command ) to the win32 directory and run the following 
batch files in the order specified
		
		i) bldall.bat
		ii) mvbin.bat

This will build all the native win32 binaries and move them to the 
.\win32\bin directory. It may be a wise idea to add the .\win32\bin
directory to your %PATH%.

Taking HEC for a spin
---------------------

Go to the win32\hasm\testapps and run the bldapps.bat batch file. This will
invoke the HASM assembler and assemble all the applications. 

If you want to assemble a HEC assembly source file, you will need to issue
a command similar to:

	..\..\bin\hasm   timedate.asm 

To run an application, you will need to issue a command similar to:

	..\..\bin\hecvm  timedate.RUN
